# These requirements were autogenerated by pipenv
# To regenerate from the project's Pipfile, run:
#
#    pipenv lock --requirements --dev

# Note: in pipenv 2020.x, "--dev" changed to emit both default and development
# requirements. To emit only development requirements, pass "--dev-only".
